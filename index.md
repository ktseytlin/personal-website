I love learning and getting out of my comfort zone.

I'm currently working at Amazon Web Services on DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) which is a caching solution on top of DynamoDB. I focus on a wide range of concerns from performance optimizations to updating client libraries to changing documentation.

Prior to that I worked on a confidential project at Amazon Web Services where I collaborated with UI/UX/Product and built the front end of new product in the React/Redux world.

And before that I was at Capital One in the big data world, working on the ingestion and transformation of terabytes and terabytes of data to power the cyber security center.

My interests are varied, and I enjoy diving deep across all aspects of software.

I'm an East Coast gal, went to college in South, and currently reside in the Pacific Northwest.
